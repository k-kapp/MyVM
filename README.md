# MyVM

All source code files must have the extension .vml. 

The commands of the VM are shown below. Parameters, where applicable, are shown in parentheses after the statement name:

+ push (integer or variable): pushes a specified integer to the top of the stack
+ pop (x)                   : pops the topmost value off the stack, and assigns its value to the variable x
+ add                       : adds the two integers at the top of the stack together, pops both off, and pushes the result to the top of the stack
+ mul                       : same as add, except multiplication instead of addition is performed
+ jmp (label)               : unconditional jump to the label specified
+ ifgt (label)              : jump to label specified if topmost value of stack is greater than zero
+ iflt (label)              : jump to label specified if topmost value of stack is less than zero
+ ifeq (label)              : jump to label specified if topmost value of stack is equal to zero
+ dup                       : pushes a duplicate of the value at the top of the stack, onto the top of the stack
+ print                     : prints the value at the top of the stack to the screen
